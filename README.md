# Academy Simulator

A group project assigned by Sparta Global to simulate the company and its expansion, with trainees being the agents whereby each trainee is either assigned to the waiting list or a training centre.

## Sprint 1 Requirements

- The tracker needs to be able to track time in a consistent way.
- The program starts by asking how long the simulation will run for.
- Every month, a random number of trainees are generated wanting to be trained (20 -30).
- Every 2 months, Sparta global opens a training centre. They open instantly and can take trainees every month
- A centre can train a max of 100 trainees and takes a random number of trainees every month. (0 - 20 trainees per month up to the max capacity).
- If a centre is full, trainees can be moved to any other centre which is not fullIf all centres are full, the trainees go onto a waiting list. 
- This list must be served first before new trainees are taken.
- At the end of the simulation, output should;
  - number of open centres
  - number of full centres
  - number of trainees currently training
  - number of trainees on the waiting list

### Planning

Initially we created user stories that can be found here on our [project board](https://github.com/kxrtiswithak/AcademySimulator/projects/3) alongside our project progress. 
Upon the creation of the user stories we used estimation using t-shirt sizing. Using these [results](https://www.planitpoker.com/board/#/room/a2a55c477cb8411fb545a9aaac1e6b96) we were able to determine 
that some of our user stories were too akin to Epics, we therefore had to reduce these down to be more clear and consise in order to fit the true nature of a user story.
